= rvincenty

This is a ruby implementation of the Vincenty's formulae to calcuclate the distance between
two points on earth. The formula assumpts that the figure of the Earth is an oblate spheroid
and is therefore much accurate than other methods which assume a spherical Earth.

The code was heavily inspired by Chris Veness Javascript implementation and explainaitions:


[Vincenty formula for distance between two Latitude/Longitude points] http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong-vincenty.html

== Usage

    require 'rvincenty'

    point_a = 45.965, 63.305    # Baikonur Cosmodrome
    point_b = 28.585, -80.651   # John F. Kennedy Space Center

    distance = RVincenty.distance(point_a, point_b)

    puts "Distance between %s and %s is %f km" % [point_a.inspect, point_b.inspect, distance / 1000]


== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
  bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
